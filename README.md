## Objective 
The goal of a Hangman game is to guess a secret word (or phrase) one letter at a time before the drawing of the hangman is completed 

## Setup 
### 1. Word Selection 
- one player (the host) thinks of a secret word or phrase and writes down blanks representing each letter 
- e.g. APPLE is displayed as _ _ _ _ _ 

### 2. Drawing Area 
- A scaffold is drawn to represent the hangman,which will be gradually completed with each  incorrect guess.

### 3. Guesses
- the other player(s) try to guess the word by suggesting one letter at a time. 

## Rules
### 1. Letter Guesses
- Players guess one letter at a time. 
- If the letter is in the word, the host fills in all occurences of that letter. 
- example guessing "P" in "APPLE" updates the display to _ P P _ _ 
- if the letter in not in the word, the host adds a part to the hangman drawing i.e. head, body, arms, legs
### 2. Incorrect Guesses
- the number of incorrect guesses allowed varies, but it usually corresponds to the number of parts in the hangman drawing usually 6 or 7 parts, head, body, two arms, two legs, and sometimes a face or base 
### 3. Winning the Game 
- the player wins if they guess all the letters of the word before the hangman drawing is completed 
### 4. Losing the Game
- the player loses if the hangman drawing is completed before they guess the word.
### 5. No Repeated Guesses
- Players cannot guess the same letter more than once. If htey do, they lose a turn.
